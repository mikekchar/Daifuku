 * logic of the application (which exists in the Context) and the
 * actual GUI (which exists in the Interaction).  Secondly, it allows
 * us to implement the GUI using more than one widget library without
 * changing the business logic.  Unfortunately, creating this separation
 * means that we need to instantiate the Interactions separately from
 * the Contexts. 
 *
 * The InteractionFactory also currently acts as a place to hold
 * string resources for all the Contexts.
 * TODO: It makes some sense to put it here, but something smells bad.
